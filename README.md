This repository contains a project focused on implementing and evaluating various 
classification models using a dataset that classifies data points as either 'Spam' or 'Ham'. 
The project involves preprocessing, feature extraction, model implementation, 
and a detailed analysis of the results based on different evaluation metrics.
